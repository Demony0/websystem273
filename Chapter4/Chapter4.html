			<p id="algebraic">Algebraic equation</p>
			<p><b>Algebraic equation</b>,statement of the equality of two expression formulated by applying to <br />a set of variables the algebraic operation,namely,addition,subtraction,multiplication,division,<br />raising to a power, and extraction of a root.Example are <i>x<sup>3</sup></i>+1 and (<i>y<sup>4</sup>x<sup>2</sup>+</i>2<i>xy-y</i>)/(<i>x</i>-1)=12.<br />An important special case of such equation is that of polynomial equation, expression of the<br />form <i>axn</i>+<i>bxn</i><sup>-1</sup>+...+<i>gx</i>+<i>h</i>=<i>k</i>. they have as many solutions as their degree (<i>n</i>), and the<br />search for their solutions stimulated much of the development of classical and modern algebra.<br />Equations like x sin (<i>x</i>) =<i> c </i> that involve nonalgebraic operations, such as logaruthms or<br /> trigonometric functions, are said to be transcendental.</p>

			<pre><p>
A chemical compound is a chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemically
bonded elements, with a fixed ratio determining the composition.
</p></pre>
<pre><p>The ratio of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula</p></pre>
<pre><p>For example, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxegyn<br />atom</p></pre>
<pre><p>The atoms within a compound can held together by a variety of interactions, ranging from </br>covelent bonds to electrostatic forces in ionic bonds</p></pre>
<pre><p>A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely covalent bond (as in H2) and ionic bonds.</p></pre>
<pre><p>For example H<sub>2</sub>O is held together by polar covalent bonds<br />Sodium chloride is an example of ionic compound.</p></pre>
